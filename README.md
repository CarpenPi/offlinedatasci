Early stage experiment

## Getting started

1. Get a Raspberry Pi 4 (current testing uses the 4GB model)
2. If the Raspberry Pi comes with NOOBS (many do)
    1. [Download a new Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
    2. [Download and install balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
    3. Use balenaEtcher to flash the Raspbain image onto your Raspberry Pi's memory card. *This requires a memory card reader, which may have come with your Raspberry Pi or may need to be purchased separately.
3. Boot up your Raspberry Pi and run the following from the terminal
    1. `sudo apt update`
    2. `sudo apt upgrade`
